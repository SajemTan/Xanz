Most songs can be and often are led by anyone who knows all the words which results in nearly everyone leading at least occasionally. Someone who leads enough songs to make it hard for others to lead is called a walab.

    - note:
      - For both of the active and the intensive, the participle uses typically refer to the celebration rather than the people celebrating. The intensive form refers specifically to the Padasi Tegyth, the 2 great festivals of the Xanz calendar. The first is the autumn harvest festival, the end of which marks the beginning of the new year. The other is in the late spring and commemorates the day on which the world is held to have been created by the Walab and Dadal of the World Beyond.

  active:
    - count
    - enumerate
    - number
  instrument:
    - number
  patient:
    - countable object or collection
    - note:
      - In common usage, gexyth is an inexact quantity of moderate size, probably greater than or equal to "several" and less than "a lot". A gexyth of money would generally constitute a decent wage and if you've been at someone's house more than a gexyth of days you've almost certainly overstayed your welcome.
      - In technical usage, gexyth can refer to a finite set or a countable set or both, depending on the author (set theory is a relatively new field and the terminology hasn't been standardized yet). It is also sometimes used to distinguish between count and mass nouns, which is a more agreed upon though less common usage as Xanz does not mark number and opportunities to study other languages have been limited until fairly recently.
